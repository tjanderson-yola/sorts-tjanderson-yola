## Problem Description



## Cheater Check

java generator 42 1400 | grep 9| ~/../../usr/bin/time java BubbleSort
java generator 42 1400 | grep -v 9| ~/../../usr/bin/time java BubbleSort

while the first command was faster, this is because the size of the list is less than for the second command, so spongebob is wrong.
